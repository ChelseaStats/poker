###### Hands

Odds of winning with pocket hands in an 8 handed game, top right is suited, bottom left unsuited. It is always a starting point in a tournament, but follow your gut instincts and watch your opponents. 

If players are loose a lower pocket pair such as fives and sixes become stronger against their range. Conversely if players are tight then stick to stronger hands and don't worry and be patient.

The less opponents, i.e. in later stages of a tournament, hands become stronger and stronger, effectively in heads up many hands are playable. From experience aggressiveness is key in heads up poker.

**Limp/RR** - Limping, and then re-raising when someone raises.

**Complete** - The act of limping from the small blind.

**Straddle** - Placing a blind raise preflop, taking last-to-act privileges from the big blind. Traditionally the straddle is made by the UTG player, although variations exist, and they are not always allowed.

**3-bet** - A re-raise. Any subsequent raises are 4-bet, 5-bet, and so-on.

**C-bet** (Continuation Bet) - A continuation bet is a bet made on the flop by the pre-flop raiser. The player is "continuing" his aggression. If the pre-flop raiser waits until the turn to bet, it is called a delayed continuation bet.

**Leading** - To make the first bet on a betting round.

**Float** - Calling a bet on one street with the intention of winning the hand on a future street without going to showdown.

**Donk Bet** - Being out of position and leading into the pre-flop raiser on the flop.

**Stop and Go** - Calling a bet out of position, then leading on the next betting round.

**Tight** - A player who plays fewer hands. They will have a stronger pre-flop range. Generally the cutoff is less than 20-22% of hands, total.

**Loose** - A player who plays many hands. They will have a weaker pre-flop range.

**Aggressive** - A player who will play a hand aggressively when they play hand. This player will prefer to bet or raise rather than to check or call.

**Passive** - A player who will play a hand passively when they play hand. This player will prefer to check or call rather than to bet or raise.

**Nit** - A player who plays very few hands from any position. Bluffing is not in their range. They will generally only play pocket pairs, AK, and maybe AQ sometimes. They won't play low pocket pairs from early position, and they won't put a lot of money into the pot without a big hand.

**TAG** - A tight, aggressive player.

**LAG** - A loose, aggressive player.

**Maniac** - Generally, a loose aggressive player taken to the extreme - playing most hands in a very aggressive manner.

**Donk**, **Donkey**, **Fish** - A weak player.

**Shark** - A skilled player.

**Reg** - A regular - an online term for a non-fish who likely has solid fundamentals.

**PP** - Pocket pair.

**SC** - Suited connector.

**TPTK** - Top pair, top kicker.

**TPGK** - Top pair, good kicker.

**TPNK** - Top pair, no kicker.

**ATC**, **A2C** - Any two cards.

**EV** (Expected Value) - The expected value of a certain decision in the long run. For instance, when you go all in for $100 with AA against a random hand, and no blinds, the EV of that play is +70 - you will stand to win your opponent's $100 85 percent of the time, and you will stand to lose your $100 15% of the time. 100*.85 + -100*.15 = +70. So while the outcome of any given occurrence of that situation will either be +100 or -100, if you were to run that situation n times, the outcome would approach 70*n.

**Equity** - Related to EV, equity is the percentage of the pot that you can lay a claim to, based on the chance that you will win the hand. If you have a 30% chance to win the hand, your equity is 30% of the pot. If you are at showdown and have won, your equity is 100% of the pot.

**VPIP** (VP$IP) - Voluntarily put money in pot. This is the percent of hands that a player voluntarily calls or raises with pre-flop. Checking the big blind does not count towards this, although calling/raising and then folding to a re-raise does. This figure can be a good indicator of a player's looseness/tightness.

**Range** - The set of hands that a player could possess at any given time during a hand. This set will tend to get smaller as the hand goes on.

**Polarization** - Polarization is the act of creating a range with hands on the polar ends of the good hand/bad hand spectrum. For instance, the most polarized range would consist of 2 hands, {AA, 23o} - one strong hand and one weak hand.

**Merging** - Merging is the act of creating a range with hands that run the gamut of the good hand/bad hand spectrum. An instance of a merged range would be the 3 hands {AA, QTo, 23o} - there is a strong hand, a medium hand, and a weak hand.

**IO** (Implied Odds) - Implied odds denote additional money that can be won on future streets if a player's hand improves.

**RIO** (Reverse Implied Odds) - Reverse implied odds denoted additional money that can be lost on future streets if a player's hand improves. For instance, player A has a flush draw with 54, but player B will only put more money into the pot when the flush hits if he has the nut flush, player A has reverse implied odds.

**FPS** - Fancy play syndrome.

**AF** (Aggression Factor) - the ratio of aggressive actions (betting, raising) to passive actions (calling).
